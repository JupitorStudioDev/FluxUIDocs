# FluxUI Documentation

Flux is a robust, hand-crafted UI component library for [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) applications. It's built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and provides a set of components that are easy to use and customize.

You can view the components in action at [https://fluxui.dev](https://fluxui.dev).
